# Maps

Examples of address autocomplete search with:
 - Google Autocomplete Widget
 - Google Autocomplete Service
 - Here Maps
 - Bing Maps
 - MapQuest

Also, there is an example validating if an address is a valid USPS deliverable shipping address. 

The examples are built using [Angular](https://angular.io/).

**Note: You need to provide API keys for each one of these services if you would like to try them out!** 

## Usage

To use the Google Autocomplete Widget and Service you will need to set the API key in `index.html`. Please replace the `XXX`s on line 14.

To use any of the other services (*Here*, *Bing*, *MapQuest*, *USPS*), please set the API key in `environment.ts`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
